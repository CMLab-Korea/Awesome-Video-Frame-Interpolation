## üìò Abstract

Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) is a fundamental task in video processing that aims to synthesize intermediate frames between existing ones, enabling smooth slow-motion effects, frame rate conversion, and temporal video enhancement. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in VFI, covering traditional motion estimation techniques, deep learning-based approaches, and emerging paradigms such as transformer-based and diffusion-based models. We present a taxonomy of VFI methods, analyze their key components, compare quantitative benchmarks, and discuss current challenges and promising future directions.
